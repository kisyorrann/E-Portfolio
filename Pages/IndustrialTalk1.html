							<p>Reflection on PPG Industrial Talk: Digital Infrastructure & Data Analytics</p>
							<p>On 20th November 2025, our lecturers managed to host an industrial talk at our faculty 
								by the PPG Industries, who are very known for their paint and coating manufacturing company. 
								Mr Vijaykumar Dhandapani, Mr Patrick Thong, Madam Lee Man Shin and Madam Ai Leng Ooi were speaker 
								of the talk, they were having the talk on Digital Infrastructure & Data Analytics. 
								By listening to their talk, I had a glimpse of look into how a global company ultimately utilises 
								the technology to drive their business effectively and efficiently. They mentioned their “One PPG”
								transformation strategy, which uses SAP S/4 Hana to process and centralise their data on a global 
								scale. It was really an eye-opener for me to see how they were embracing multi-cloud, such as Azure, 
								Aws and Oracle, to be more stable and secure. They really highlighted the essential skills for 
								succeeding in this modern Computer Science era.</p>
                            <p>We also did a Poster for this Industrial Visit. <a href = "https://www.canva.com/design/DAG65OxmD2E/XJ2FFBCLBK87-7UrC1q-mg/edit">Click Here for the Poster.</a></p>
