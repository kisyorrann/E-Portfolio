							<p>Reflection on SERUNAI Industrial Talk: Project Management & System Development</p>
							<p>On 18th December 2025, Serunai Commerce held an Industrial Talk at N28a, Faculty of Computing, 
								about Project Management & System Development. This talk was attended by Ts. Hj. Abdul Alim 
								from Serunai Commerce Sdn Bhd.</p>
							<p></p>
							<p>This talk was by far the most enlightening experience, which shifted my view on the Computer Science
								field. We learned that this field is not about mere coding but beyond that, things like the 
								System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to manage the complex projects heavily required on the 
								structed framework to ensure the projects are user-friendly to the people. His final touch of 
								this talk was to become a successful and stand-out graduate. We need to combine technical 
								proficiency with strong project management skills. </p>
							<p></p>
							<p>The talk was very effective for the students and informative to help them grow in this 
								computer science course.</p>
                            <p>We also did a Academic Writing for this Industrial Talk. <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Mo7j1B0ttqExTls8kUTFZCBToo5jTf9F7pteyAsXD0c/edit?usp=sharing">Click Here for the Academic Writing.</a></p>
