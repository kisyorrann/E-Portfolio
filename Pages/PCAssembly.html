							<p>Reflection on PC Assembly at UTM:</p>
							<p>On 6th November 2025, I had the opportunity to attend a practical session for our 
								subject Technology & Information Systems (SECP1513) with Dr Suriati. During this session, 
								we were taught how to disassemble and reassemble a PC. We were well supervised by the staff. </p>
							<p>I was able to learn how to handle components such as RAM, Hard Drive, CPU cooler, 
								Power Supply Unit (PSU), and Motherboard Power Connectors. We disassembled and 
								reassembled components, and at last, we made sure they functioned well.</p>
							<p>This session provided me with an excellent learning experience in assembling or repairing a PC 
								all by myself. Immediately after the session was conducted, we had a quiz session on assembling a PC.
								I had a great time and learned new knowledge, especially on PC. </p>
